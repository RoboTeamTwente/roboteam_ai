# This travis image builds roboteam_suite and runs the target 'world_tests'.
# All other repositories of roboteam_suite are set to the master branch.
# We need all dependencies to parse the cmake files. This can be optimized later,
# but with caching this is not a large performance hit anyway.

# First we set up the compiler to use ccache.
# then clone roboteam_suite and put all repositories on master.
# then we replace roboteam_world from rtt_suite with the branch you are currently on to test this branch specifically.
# As a temporary solution we currently need development of roboteam_ai since master has no mac support yet.
# Finally, we run the tests.
