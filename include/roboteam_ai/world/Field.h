/**
 * Stores all data which is directly obtained by the field camera (this data can change during the match) and store all
 * singular constant data (data that does not change through the match) about the field, which combined includes: <br>
 * - Length, widths, heights of the field, goals and boundary. <br>
 * - The location, direction and sizes of all lines on the field. <br>
 * - The location and sizes of all arcs on the field. <br>
 * - Important and frequently used locations of the field, e.g. positions around our and the opponents goal.
 *
 * All these values are expressed in meters. Moreover the encoding of the field looks like:
 *
 *                          (upperFieldLine)
 *              (-x,y)_________________________ (x,y)
 *                 |                              |
 *                 |                              |
 * (your side)     |             (0,0)            | (their side)
 * (leftFieldLine) |                              | (rightFieldLine)
 *                 |                              |
 *              (-x, -y)_______________________(x, -y)
 *                          (bottomFieldLine)
 *
 * Thus the left side of the field always corresponds to our side of the field and the right side of the field always corresponds to the opponents side of the field. Moreover
 * every horizontal line of the field stored as FieldLineSegment has their begin position equal to the leftmost position of that line (position with the lowest x-coordinate) and
 * their end position equal to the rightmost position of that line (position with highest x-coordinate). And every vertical line of the field stored as FieldLineSegment has their
 * begin position equal to the bottommost position of that line (position with the lowest y-coordinate) and their end position equal to the topmost position of that line (position
 * with the highest y-coordinate). The top/bottom penalty stretches are an exception for this: they have their end position always inwards the field.
