     * Structure that represents the world and history of the world.

     * This structure operates under the assumption of an immutable state
     * Adjusting any value inside this world after construction may
     * result in undefined behavior. Any sort of mutation of already constructed
     * WorldData will break the entire system and introduce dataraces due to
     * a shared immutable state.
     *
     * WorldData is a snapshot of the current world as seen by the camera
     * Feedback is already applied to the robots when they are constructed
     * As soon as a new world is constructed, which should only be done
     * through updateWorld, the current world is pushed to history, given that
     * this is a Some variant. Using any other unconventional way to push
     * a world to history will result in undefined behavior.
     *
     * The entire system with World relies on immutability,
     * this is something that Rust and haskell enforce and is seen as
     * one of the only ways to keep a project datarace-free
